            <h1>A Brief History of JavaScript</h1>
            <p>JavaScript is a programming language that represents one of the three core languages used to develop websites, alongside HTML and CSS. Whereas HTML and CSS give a website structure and style, JavaScript lets you add functionality and behaviors to your website. This allows visitors to interact with your website in various creative ways.</p>
            <p>Mosaic was the first web browser with a graphical user interface. It was first released in 1993 and played a key role in the rapid development of the web as we know it today. The lead developers of Mosaic founded Netscape (now Mozilla) and released a more elegant browser called Netscape Navigator in 1994.</p>
            <p>During the early years of the web, web pages were only static, with no capability for dynamic behavior and interactivity. As a result, there was an urge in the web development community at the time to eliminate this limitation. This led Netscape to the decision to add a scripting language to the Navigator browser.</p>
            <p>In September 1995, a Netscape programmer named Brendan Eich developed a new scripting language in just 10 days. It was originally called Mocha, but quickly became known as LiveScript and, later, JavaScript.</p>
            <p>The language derived its syntax from Java, its first-class functions from Scheme, and its prototype-based inheritance from Self. Since then, JavaScript has been adopted by all major graphical web browsers.</p>
